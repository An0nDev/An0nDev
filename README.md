### What I'm working on
HTStack: basically a super easy way to build and deploy web applications in C++

### What's coming next
I don't have a name for it yet but I want to write a data abstraction layer for applications.
What I want to do is eliminate the step of building web interfaces that involves HTML/JS/CSS.
This would be done by automatically generating the code for the interface based on predefined constraints associated with named datasets.
This will probably be in C++ as well.

Special thanks to @connervieira for being a real cool dude by reading my two paragraphs on my ideas for this and saying:

so that's what I'm going for.
