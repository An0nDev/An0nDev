Hey! :wave: I write code for... some reason, I guess. Fun? Sure, we'll go with that.


### What I'm working on
HTStack: basically a super easy way to build and deploy web applications in C++.
It works, sorta... I'm working on a better way to configure web applications at runtime, and I'm missing some crucial HTTP/2 stuff like WebSockets.
But it's a work-in-progress, and I'm updating it in my spare time.

### What's coming next
I'm writing a data abstraction layer for applications.
What I want to do is eliminate the step of building web interfaces that involves HTML/JS/CSS.
This would be done by automatically generating the code for the interface based on predefined constraints associated with named datasets.
This will probably be in C++ as well.
**Update March 2021**: The previous name was 'BigMassive'; I'm now calling it 'onedef', as in one definition of data types and user interface constraints to produce the entire application. I'm working on JS/client and Python/server interpreters for the system definition file. Eventually I want to build native interpreters for desktop/mobile clients. The last part would be transpilers to generate standalone code for web/native clients and servers (ideally C++ for performance).

Special thanks to [@connervieira](https://github.com/connervieira) for being a real cool dude, reading my two paragraphs on my ideas for this, and saying:

so that's what I'm going for.
